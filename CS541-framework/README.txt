All functions should be implemented, and the only differences between the handout and my implementation are that I use the 'T' instead of 'TAB' to toggle from navigation mode and 'skycam' mode.

Proj 2 - The only special feature is that I used the approximation (GVALUE / (LN * VN)) -> 1 / (LH * LH)
